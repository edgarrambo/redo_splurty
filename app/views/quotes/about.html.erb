  <br />
  <p>
  My name is Edgar Alonzo am I using Splurty to increase his skills in HTML, CSS, and Ruby. I was part of the University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp. This is the second time I create Splurty, looks way better than the first time(adding some of my own twist in there too). My hobbies are to code on my time off, play soccer, walk my dog, and travel when things are good. Currently in quarentine, doing some freelance work and using this time to brush up on my skilss and apply to new positions.
